description=Features:
description=[list]
description=[*]RP-friendly language.
description=[*]Respawn with a configurable skill loss chance - for RP purposes this helps enforce valuing your character's life and giving skillbooks, exercise equipment, etc. all a reason to continue to exist and be used.
description=[*]Chance to lose a skill and how much can be lost is configurable on a per-skill basis.
description=[*]Omitting a skill from the list will mean it cannot be lost during respawn.
description=[*]Listing a skill with no settings will use the values above in the sandbox options.
description=[*]Supports modded skills out of the box, just configure them like any other skill.
description=[/list]
description=
description=The Skill Configuration sandbox option is semicolon-delimited and in the format of SkillName=ChanceToLose:MaxToLose; - the name is the normal in-game name, and the chances are in 0-100 percentage format.

description=Planned Features:
description=[list]
description=[*]I tried to make the character "say" what skills were affected but there's no good "hook" to put code for that so it is not displaying at present. I intend to continue to look into this and enable that feature.
description=[*]Recipes do not restore yet even though code is present for it, need to look into that.
